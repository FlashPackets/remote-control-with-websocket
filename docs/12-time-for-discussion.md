## Time For Discussion

We have come to the end of this tutorial. I hope you enjoyed it, and that you found some recipes to reproduce in your personal projects. I hope I didn't make it too boring and, at the same time, I hope I've gone into enough detail to make sure you understood it. If there are still some grey areas, I encourage you to come and discuss with me on GitHub by creating an issue:

[Leave me a message][discussion]{: .btn .btn-purple }
{: .center }

I'll try to answer your questions as quickly as possible.

I look forward to hearing from you...


[WebSocket & JSON]({{ '/websocket-and-json/' | relative_url }}){: .btn }
{: .navigator }



[discussion]: {{ site.github.issues_url }}
