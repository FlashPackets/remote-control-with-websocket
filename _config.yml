title: ESP32 Remote Control with WebSocket
description: This tutorial details the use of WebSocket to remotely interact with an ESP32 that exposes a web application through an HTTP server. The WebSocket protocol opens a two-way communication channel between the client browser and the HTTP server run by the ESP32. With this API you can send messages to a server and receive its responses on an event-driven basis without having to go to the server for a response.
